## Description

_In this web application the user is promted to fill out a few different data fields like; name, age, gender, how much they like fireworks and their proximity to a nuclear power plant. With just their age we are able to calculate how many solar-years old they would be if they were born on another planet. From some of the other information the user has inputted we are able to roughly determine their estimated lifespan. Once we know the user's estimated lifespan we can then tell them how many solar-years old they would potentially live to if they were born on another planet._
